Figure 2A - 3 integrated modalities at 7.5GW,"A snapshot of the WebAtlas portal visualising integrated scRNA-seq, ISS and Visium dataset of the human lower limb. The Vitessce widget windows show the following as numbered. 1) UMAP representation of cell types in scRNA-seq dataset with 6 queried cell types highlighted in colour.  2) Spatial map of segmented single cells in ISS tissue section highlighting the queried cell type set. Insets show raw microscopy images of DAPI and cell segmentation label masks that can be viewed on the portal. 3) Visium tissue section with spot label masks. Insets show raw H&E images and Visium spot label masks.  4) Cell set search console to cross-query multiple cell types across scRNA-seq and ISS datasets. 5) Cell type search console to cross-query a single cell type across all three datasets including Visium. 6) Gene search console to cross-query gene expression across all datasets.
