The extraembryonic yolk sac (YS) ensures delivery of nutritional support and oxygen to the developing embryo, but remains ill-defined in humans. We therefore assembled a comprehensive multiomic reference of human YS from 3-8 post conception weeks by integrating single-cell protein and gene expression data. Beyond its recognized role as a site of hematopoiesis, we highlight roles in metabolism, coagulation, vascular development, and hematopoietic regulation. We reconstructed the emergence and decline of YS hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from hemogenic endothelium and revealed a YS-specific accelerated route to macrophage production that seeds developing organs. The multiorgan functions of YS are superseded as intraembryonic organs develop, effecting a multifaceted relay of vital functions as pregnancy proceeds.
