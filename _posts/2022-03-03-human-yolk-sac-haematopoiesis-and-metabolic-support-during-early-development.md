Yolk sacs (YS) are highly-conserved extraembryonic structures. In phylogenetic terms, YS are first seen in vertebrates with yolk-rich eggs e.g. birds, reptiles and amphibians, where their role is to extract macronutrients from yolk to sustain the embryo. In many mammals, YS fuse with the chorion, forming an early placenta that facilitates nutrient transfer during organogenesis. In humans there is no yolk and no fusion with the chorion: the YS floats within the extraembryonic cavity tethered only to the embryo via the vitelline circulation. These differences have led to debate about whether the human YS is vestigial or whether it serves a specific function during embryonic development.
