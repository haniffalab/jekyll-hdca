Human skin organogenesis begins after gastrulation from two primary germ layers: the ectoderm differentiates to eventually form the epidermis, the most superficial layer of skin, and the mesoderm differentiates to form the dermis, which lies just deep to the epidermis, separated by the basement membrane1. At 7-8 days of gestation, the epidermis is formed of a single layer of ectodermal cells2. By 4 PCW this has transformed into two layers: a basal cell layer and an outer layer known as the periderm3 that represents the first permeability barrier. Cells from the periderm are shed into the amniotic fluid following the second trimester4 once epidermal stratification begins.
