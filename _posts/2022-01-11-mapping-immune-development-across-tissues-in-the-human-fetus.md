Single-cell genomics studies have decoded the immune cell composition of several human prenatal organs, but were limited in understanding the developing immune system as a distributed network across tissues. We profiled nine prenatal tissues combining single-cell RNA sequencing, antigen-receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reconstruct the developing human immune system. We revealed late acquisition of immune effector functions of myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets, and the maturation of monocytes and T cells prior to peripheral tissue seeding. We uncovered system-wide blood and immune cell development beyond primary hematopoietic organs, characterized human prenatal B1 cells, and shed light on the origin of unconventional T cells. Our atlas provides both valuable data resources and biological insights that will facilitate cell engineering, regenerative medicine and disease understanding.
